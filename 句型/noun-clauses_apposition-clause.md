# 1. 同位语从句

## 1.1 同位语从句用于对其所修饰的**名词**或**代词**作进一步解释，说明名词的具体内容  

也就是说同位语从句和所修饰的名词在内容上为同一关系

## 1.2 常用的后跟同位语从句的抽象名词(n: apposition-clause)

## 1.3 同位语从句的引导词有that,whether,what,which,who,when,where,why,how等

### 1.3.1 同位语从句意义完整时应该用that引导，(that不充当任何成分，只起连接作用，不可省略)

* We received the order that we should finish this task at once  
* 我们收到了立即完成任务的命令(`we should finish this task at once`是the order的全部内容，且意义完整）

### 1.3.2 同位语从句意义不完整，需要增加“是否”的含义时，应用whether引导(if不能引导同位语从句)  

* We are talking about the problem whether we should buy a new car  
* (`we should buy a new car`意思表达不完整，应加“是否”的含义才能表达the problem的全部内容)  

### 1.3.3 同位语从句意义不完整，需要增加“什么时候”的含义时，应用when引导

* I have no idea when I can get my book    
* (`I can get my book`意思表达不完整，应加“什么时候”的含义才能表达idea的全部内容)  

### 1.3.4 同位语从句意义不完整，需要增加“什么地点”的含义时，应用where引导

### 1.3.5 同位语从句意义不完整，需要增加“什么方式”的含义时，应用how引导

* I have no impression how we met each other at first    
* (`we met each other at first`意思表达不完整，应加“如何”的含义才能表达impression的全部内容) 

## 1.4 当主句的谓语较短，而同位语从句较长时，同位语从句常后置  

* The idea came to his mind that he had put his key in the drawer  
* 他突然想起来他把钥匙放在抽屉里了  

## 1.5 在suggestion,advice,request,order等意为“建议、命令、要求”的名词后，同位语从句中的谓语动词常用"should+动词原形"的虚拟语气结构，should可省略  

* He gave me some suggestions how I (should) use the microscope  
* 他给了我一些如何使用显微镜的建议  

* My teacher gave us some advice that I (should) read English every day

## 1.6 同位语从句与定语从句的区别

### 1.6.1 同位语从句和定语从句都是放在某个名词或代词后面  

### 1.6.2 定语从句属于形容词性从句范畴，是对其先行词的修饰或限制；而同位语从句属于名词性从句的范畴，它和前面的先行词之间是同位关系  

* The idea that he told me just now is impractical  
* (定语从句，翻译为：“它告诉我的”想法不切实际，从句he told me just now具与形容词性)  

* The news that you will go abroad is true  
* (同位语从句, 从句you will go abroad是名词性的，对news作进一步的说明)  

* The news that I read in the newspaper is shocking  
* (定语从句)  

* The news that you will get promoted is true  
* (同位语从句)  

* I made a dicision that changed all the situation  
* 我做了个改变全局的决定(定语从句)  

* I made a dicision that if you love me I would marry you  
* (同位语从句)  

### 1.6.3 定语从句的先行词可以是：名词、代词、主句的一部分或者整个句子，而同位语从句的先行词只能是有一定内涵的名词  

* The girl whom you are looking for is in the shop  
* (定语从句)  

* We will get married, which made us very happy  
* (定语从句)  

* He did all he could to help his wife with her housework  
* (定语从句, 代词all作先行词)

* The possibility that this method will work is being discussed now  
* (同位语从句)

* Word came that he divorced  
* 据说他离婚了(同位语从句)  

* We are talking about the question whether she should be punished  
* (同位语从句)  

### 1.6.4 同位语从句的引导词在剧中不做任何成分，而定语从句的引导词要

* The idea that he gave just now was wonderful  
* (定语从句)  

* The idea that the earth is flat has long been discredited  
* 地球是方的这种说法早就不为人们所相信了(同位语从句)  

### 1.6.5 有些引导词whether,how,what可以引导同位语从句，而不能引导定语从句  

* I have no idea what I should do to help her  
* (同位语从句)  

### 1.6.6 引导词that在引导同位语从句时，不能省略，且不能用which替代

* the order that we should lock the doors was given by him  
* (同位语从句,是对order的具体解释，that虽然不做成分，但是不能省略)

* the order that he give us was that we should lock the doors  
* (定语从句，是名词的修饰语，that在句中做gave的宾语，可以省略)  

* I have asked the question when you will come back  
* (同位语从句, when引导的从句表示疑问)

* Do you remember the day when we bought the house?
* (定语从句，when引导的从句不表示疑问)
