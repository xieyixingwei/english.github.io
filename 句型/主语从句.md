## 1.1 主语从句和it形式主语  

为了保持句子平衡, 主语从句常用`it`作**形式主语**，大部分`主语从句`都可以用`it`做形式主语，将主语从句置后，分以下几种情况：  

对于用连词`that`引导的主语从句，通常可以用形式主语`it`代替主语从句
===

- It's necessary that you take an umberlla. 你带把伞很有必要  
- > That you take an umberlla is necessary.

- It's a pity that you lost it. 你把它弄丢了很可惜
- > That you lost it is a pity.

`that`引导的主语从句位于句首时，`that`不可以省略；`that`引导的主语从句位于句末时，用`it`形式主语，则可以省略`that`
===

- That you are winner is the best news. 最好的消息是你是冠军
- > It is the best news (that) you are the winner  

对于关系代词`what`引导的主语从句，通常直接把主语从句放在句首，有时也可以用`it`形式主语
===

- What you want is time.你想要的是时间  
- What he tell is the truth. 他说的是事实(真相)  

- It is obvious what we must do. 我们该做什么是很明显的
- > What we must do is obvious.

对于用连接代词`whatever`和`whichever`或副词`how`和`why`引导的`主语从句`，可以用`it`形式主语，也可以直接把主语从句放在句首  
===

- Whether he would accept this was a question. 他是否接受是个问题
- > It's a question that whether he would accept this   

如果句子是疑问句，一定要用`it`形式主语  
==

- Is it true that he was fired? 他被炒鱿鱼了是真的吗？
- > That he was fired is true.

- How is it that they didn't come? 他们为什么没来？
