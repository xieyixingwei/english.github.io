# 1. 主语从句

1. 在复合句中用作主语的从句叫主语从句  

2. 主语从句通常由以下词来引导：  
+ 连词**that**和**whether**  
+ 连接代词**whatever** 和 **whichever**  
+ 连接副词**how** 和 **why**
+ 关系代词**what**  

* That he is still alive is sheer luck  
* 他还活着全靠运气  

* That you have cheated me is certain  
* 你欺骗了我是肯定的  

* Whether the plan is feasible remains to be proved  
* 这一计划是否可行还有待证实  

* What he wants to tell us is not clear  
* 他要给我们说什么，还不清楚  

* What I am finding is a nail  
* 我正在找的是个钉子  

* Whatever I do is wrong  
* 无论我做什么都是错的

## 1.1 主语从句和it形式主语  

为了保持句子平衡, 主语从句常用**it**作**形式主语**，大部分主语从句都可以用it做形式主语，将主语从句置后，分以下几种情况：  

1. 对于用连词that引导的主语从句，通常可以用形式主语it代替主语从句

* It's necessary that you take an umberlla -> That you take an umberlla is necessary  
* 你带把伞很有必要  

* It's a pity that you lost it -> That you lost it is a pity  
* 你把它弄丢了很可惜  

that引导的主语从句位于句首时，that不可以省略；that引导的主语从句位于句末时，用it形式主语，则可以省略that

* That you are winner is the best news -> It is the best news (that) you are the winner  
* 最好的消息是你是冠军  

2. 对于关系代词what引导的主语从句，通常直接把主语从句放在句首，有时也可以用it形式主语

* What you want is time 
* 你想要的是时间  

* What he tell is the truth  
* 他说的是事实(真相)  

* It is obvious what we must do -> What we must do is obvious  
* 我们该做什么是很明显的  

3. 对于用连接代词**whatever** 和 **whichever**或副词**how** 和 **why**引导的主语从句，可以用it形式主语，也可以直接把主语从句放在句首  

* Whether he would accept this was a question  -> It's a question that whether he would accept this  
* 他是否接受是个问题  

4. 如果句子是疑问句，一定要用it形式主语  

* Is it true that he was fired? -> That he was fired is true  
* 他被炒鱿鱼了是真的吗？  

* How is it that they didn't come?  
* 他们为什么没来？
