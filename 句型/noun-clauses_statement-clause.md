# 1. 表语从句  

1. 表语从句是一个句子，说明主语是什么或者怎么样的句子叫表语从句

2. 表语可由：**名词**，**形容词**，**相当于名词或形容词的词或短语**充当，和连系动词一起构成谓语

* My opinion is that her advice should be practical  

* The question is that we have no money  

## 1.1 表语从句的分类  

1. 连系动词引导的表语从句  

+ be动词  
+ look  
+ seem  
+ sound  
+ appear  

* It seems we have made a progress  

2. `as, as if, though`引导的表语从句  

* It look as if we were sleeping  
* 似乎他正在睡觉  

3. `because、why`引导的表语从句  

* That is because I practiced a lot  
* 那是我拼命练习的结果（That's because 强调原因）  

* That is why he came  
* 那是他来的原因（That's why 强调结果）  

4. 使用虚拟语气的表语从句  

表示**劝告**、**建议**、**命令**、等含义的**名词**后的**表语从句**，谓语动词需用`should + 动词原形`表示，should可省略，常见的词有：  

+ plan  
+ advice  
+ suggestion  
+ order  
+ proposal  
+ idea  

* My idea is that we should do it in this way  
* 我的意见是我们应该这样做    

* His proposal was that we should hold a meeting.  
* 他的提议是我们应该开个会  

## 1.2 表语从句的注意事项

1. 表语从句一定要用陈述语序  

2. 表语从句不可以用`if`连词，而用`whether`连接(`as if`除外)

* The question is whether he can do it  
* 问题是他能不能做  

* It looks as if things went well  
* 看来事情进展很顺利  

3. 有表语从句的复合句中，主句时态和从句时态可以不一致  

* The question is who had accepted my advice  
* 问题是谁接受了我的建议  

* The problem is where he had gone  
* 问题是他去那里了  

4. `That is why` `That is the reason why` `That is because`句型  

`That is why` 是常用句型，意为“那就是...什么的原因/因此....”，其中`why`引导的名词性从句在句中作表语，该句型用于对前面已经说明过的原因进行总结  

* that is why I am here  

* that is why I cry  

`That is the reason why` 与`That is why` 同义，只不过从语法上来讲，前者的`why`引导的是定语从句  

* That is (the reason) why I was angry  

`That is because` 意为“那就是为什么.../因为...”，指的是原因，而`That is why`  指的是由于各种原因造成的结果。because引导的名词性从句在此做表语  

* You make a progress. That is because you have made a good decision  
* 你取得了进步，那是因为你做了个正确的决定  

* She has a good husband. That is why she is so happy  
* 她有个好丈夫，那就是她如此幸福的原因
